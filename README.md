Problem

A distributor receives daily inventory feeds from our suppliers and needs to extract data to store
in the supplier inventory table. They want to have an automated job, scheduled daily, that processes each supplier
file from a common directory and inserts into/updates table SUPPLIER_PRODUCT.
Table                       Column                            Notes
SUPPLIER_PRODUCT            SUPPLIER_ID *                     Primary key is (SUPPLIER_ID, PRODUCT_ID)
                            PRODUCT_ID *
                            QUANTITY

The feeds are different for each supplier, and the type can be either tab-delimited text, CSV, or Excel files. They are
transferred to the same directory on our server with standardized names ( <supplierID>.extension ). Some
suppliers may have extra columns in the feed, but they all guarantee to provide one column containing the product
ID and one column containing the quantity (whose column indices can vary from supplier to supplier). Each
product ID appears only once in a file.

Sample supplier feeds:
- Supplier A (CSV):
  Product,Price,Quantity,LastUpdated
  DEFG,40.17,2,2013-10-02
  ABC,10.30,15,2014-11-26
  HIJ,152.45,53,2014-02-17
  
- Supplier B (tab-delimited):
  row_number  product brand inventory
  1 KLMN  Honeywell 34
  2 HIJ Taco  452
  3 OPQ Panasonic 77
  4 ABC Taco  10

Design the Java classes, their member variables and methods signatures to support this automation project, with a
focus on how to handle different file types and formats. Feel free to use supporting database tables if necessary
(specify columns, primary keys, foreign keys). As with Question 1, please include any assumptions you make.
Deliverables:
- Java files with class skeletons, and sufficient in-file documentation. Don't implement any method, as we are only
interested in how you design data structures.
- A document file (text, Word, PDF, or any format that we can likely open) describing the database schema, if you
use tables
